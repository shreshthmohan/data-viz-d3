- companies.tsv is the original data file. It already contains the overall and split positions of the circles ([cx, cy], [x, y])
- But we shall, at least, initially run a force simulation on the client to show the circle postions
- (~) Maybe, we can later add a way to pre-calculate positions using a worker?
- Some companies in the data are now defunct (or not in the S&P 500 anymore), would be interesting to do a "death by tax" analysis of these. One example is Computer Sciences Corporation.
